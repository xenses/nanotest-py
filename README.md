nanotest
========

A tiny testing toolkit, inspired by Perl's `Test::More` and
`Test::Harness`.

* Not xUnit style -- tests are function calls, not classes
* Very simple -- only 4 functions in the whole library
* Powerful -- value comparisons can be tested against regexes
* Powerful-er -- arbitrary data structures can be tested for congruence

*Don't complain that testing is too hard! Use nanotest and get to work!*


Implementations
---------------

There are currently two implementations of nanotest: Python and
Javascript.

Despite having been written first, the Javascript implementation is
currently very much a second-class citizen. It had been languishing in
another repo instead of living here alongside its brother, so it was
easy to ignore. I will bring the js implementation up to parity before
long, I promise :)
