nanotest-py
===========

A reimplementation of `nanotest.js` from my Javascript library, which
is itself a tiny, fragmentary implementation of Perl's `Test::More`.

This package includes `nanotest.py`, which is the test library proper,
and `nanotest`, a script which acts as the test
harness/runner. Installation is standard:

    python setup.py install

See `pydoc nanotest` for details on use and how to write test scripts.
