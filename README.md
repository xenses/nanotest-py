This is the Python implementation of nanotest, a tiny testing
library. Python 3.2+ is required due to use of the `argparse` module.


Installation
------------

To run nanotest's own tests before installation:

    ./bin/nanotest-py

After that, installation is standard:

    python setup.py install

See `nanotest-py --help` for information on how to run tests. Read the
Tutorial document to learn how to write tests.


Changes and additions in version 2
----------------------------------

Nanotest v2 is a near-total rewrite, and as the major version number
bump indicates, it is backward-incompatible with the version 1 API.

Summarizing all changes and new capabilitis would amount to an (even)
shorter version of the tutorial, so I recommend simply discarding
everything you knew about nanotest and starting over.
