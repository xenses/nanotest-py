nanotest-py Changelog

1.1.1     22 Aug 2011

          bin/nanotest now has two command-line options: --quiet (only
          print errors) and --silent (produce no output). These allow
          it to be much better integrated into an automated process.

1.1.0     20 Aug 2011

          BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The end-of-script summary
          function has had a name change. It is now 'nanotest_summary'
          instead of the obtuse 'test_print_summary'.

          New testing function: pis_deeply(). Tests arbitrary
          structures for congruence (that is, they have the same
          structure and the same values at all endpoints of the
          structure).

          bin/nanotest now exits with status 1 when tests fail. When a
          test script aborts, it exits with the scripts status.

          bin/nanotest now sorts test files before running (bugfix)
