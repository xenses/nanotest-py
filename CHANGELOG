1.2.0     03 May 2012

          The 'nanotest' runner/harness now takes a list of tests to
          run as positional arguments, providing functionality
          equivalent to that of Test::Harness's 'prove'

1.1.6     29 Mar 2012

          Fixed bug where dictionaries with integer keys would crash
          nanotest.

1.1.5     04 Nov 2011

          nanotest now aborts and tries to be helpful when it looks
          like a test script didn't call nanotest_summary()

1.1.4     15 Sep 2011

          Regexes can now be used on the given (right-hand) side of
          any test.

          Tutorial!

          All testing functions now return True or False, to be more
          useful outside the nanotest runner+script environment.

          Minor output tweaks, internal rework, and bugfixes.

1.1.3     07 Sep 2011

          Bugfix: non-string values were not being coerced before
          regex test.

1.1.2     07 Sep 2011

          Given values in pis_deeply() tests can now be regexes, to
          allow pattern-based comparison.

1.1.1     22 Aug 2011

          bin/nanotest now has two command-line options: --quiet (only
          print errors) and --silent (produce no output). These allow
          it to be much better integrated into an automated process.

1.1.0     20 Aug 2011

          BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The end-of-script summary
          function has had a name change. It is now 'nanotest_summary'
          instead of the obtuse 'test_print_summary'.

          New testing function: pis_deeply(). Tests arbitrary
          structures for congruence (that is, they have the same
          structure and the same values at all endpoints of the
          structure).

          bin/nanotest now exits with status 1 when tests fail. When a
          test script aborts, it exits with the scripts status.

          bin/nanotest now sorts test files before running (bugfix)

          bugfixes and tweaks to nanotest.py            

1.0.3     12 Aug 2011

          Output formatting improvements

1.0.2     10 Aug 2011

          Always include './' in PYTHONPATH

1.0.1     09 Aug 2011

          Test scripts are now .py, not .t

          bin/nanotest now self-discovers modules and adds them to
          PYTHONPATH for its test invocations.

1.0.0     08 Aug 2011

          Initial release
