The Python implementation of nanotest requires Python 3.2+.

This package includes `nanotest.py`, which is the test library proper,
and `nanotest`, a script which acts as the test harness/runner.

If you want to run the package's own tests before installation, feel
free:

    ./bin/nanotest

Installation is standard:

    python setup.py install

See `pydoc nanotest` or the Tutorial for details on how to write test
scripts. See `nanotest --help` for information on how to run tests.
